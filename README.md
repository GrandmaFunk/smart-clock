# Smart Clock
A smart clock which displays the current time and communicates with the [Smart Frame](https://github.com/GrandmaFunk/smart-frame) via a Google Cloud Firestore database. This clock sends new messages which the frame is listening for. The clock also listens for a boolean value which the frame can trigger, causing the clock to change blinking colors.

Made for the [Pimoroni Unicorn Hat Mini](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/unicorn-hat-mini).
